# 👋 Hey, I'm Vinay Tawde

> Building with purpose — I craft solutions using AI, data, and clean code.  
> Curious by nature, developer by choice.

I'm a developer focused on **applied AI**, **data pipelines**, and **intelligent systems** that solve real problems.  
Whether it’s building LLM agents or working with raw scientific data, I love turning complex challenges into elegant code that **works, scales, and makes sense**.

Currently exploring the edges of language models, automation, and explainability in ML.  
Always learning. Always shipping. 🚀

## 🧪 Projects I've Worked On

### 📄 MULTI-MODAL-PDF-GPT
A smart document AI that understands multilingual, mixed-format PDFs using:
- 🧠 **CrewAI agents** for intelligent task execution  
- 🌍 **Facebook NLLB-200** for multilingual translation  
- 🦙 **LLaMA-based LLMs** for contextual analysis  
- 🖼️ **Tesseract OCR** for extracting image-embedded text  

Built to handle real-world PDFs — text, tables, images, and everything in between.

### 🧠 Clinical Support Hub (AI + RAG)
Multi-agent Streamlit app for psychiatric assistance using **LangChain**, **Groq LLM**, and **ChromaDB**.  
Tested in collaboration with LTMG Hospital for real-use feedback.

---

### 🌌 Space Weather Pipeline
Processed NASA solar wind data with **SpacePy** — cleaned `.cdf` files, extracted plasma metrics, and generated 8-panel scientific plots.

---

### 🤖 Dataset by LLMs for Mental Health Diagnostics
Created synthetic datasets for six disorders, trained models with **BERT** and traditional ML, and applied **LIME**  for interpretability.  
Published in **ETTIS 2025**.
